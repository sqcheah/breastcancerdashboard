# Breast Cancer Dashboard - 2021

This is a simple project to populate interative table and chart from local dataset and dynamic dataset that are hosted online.
Our chosen topic is breast cancer. We decided to make it as subscription based for hospital to access our data.

This project is using PHP, MySQL, datatables and chart.js

The database is used to manage articles and user subscription.
